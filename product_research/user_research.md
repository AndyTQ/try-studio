# User Research

We prepared an interactive Figma prototype to test the user experience with two potential customers of our product. We began by asking if they're okay with the study being recorded, then introduced the study with the following script:

> Thank you for participating in this user research study. The purpose of the study is for us to validate and improve the interface of our product. Note that we are testing the product, not you, and there are no mistakes or incorrect answers. I’ll discuss a scenario, then you’ll be asked to complete a short series of tasks. While doing this, please “think aloud” with all comments and ask any questions that come to mind. Do you have any questions before we begin?

The following two scenarios explore how different customers might want to use the product.

## User Scenario 1 (Festival planner)

> In this scenario, you are planning a festival. There will be music played at the event, thus you are required to get a music performance license. Normally, you would go to the ASCAP website for this, but in this scenario, you’ll use our website to obtain the license. Please complete the following tasks:
> 1.	Login
> 2.	Create a new license
> 3.	Pay the license fee
> 4.	Print the license certificate

### Post Scenario Questions
*	Was any step difficult to complete?
    * No
*	What was confusing about the interface?
    * Nothing
*	Do you have any suggestions as we move forward?
    * A place for users to specify an "Other" type of event if they don't see exactly what they're looking for.

### Analysis
User 1 easily completed tasks 1-3. Upon logging-in, she immediately located the "My Licenses" section on the sidebar. Following this, she used the "New License" button in the sidebar dropdown instead of the button above the license list.

After going through the (pre-filled) license questionnaire and validating their answers, she created then paid for the license. She couldn't identify the button to go to the license certificate screen, required for step 4. Instead she clicked the non-sidebar "New License" button.

After returning to the list of licenses, User 1 discovered that items in the list were interactive and quickly finished step 4 to complete the study.

## User Scenario 2 (Karaoke bar)

> In this scenario, you will be paying the annual music performance licensing fee for your business. Normally, you would go to the SOCAN or Entandem website to do this. in this scenario, you’ll use our website to obtain the license. Please complete the following tasks:
> 1.	Login
> 2.	Create a new license
> 3.	Pay the license fee
> 4.	Print the license certificate
