# Roadmap

![Roadmap](./roadmap.png)
In summary, a proof-of-concept will be ready by the end of February. This will let us finish user research and testing of the proof-of-concept by early March. The MVP's main functionalities will be finished by late March so we can ship in early April. The business will focus on scaling and expanding in May and beyond.
