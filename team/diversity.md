Diversity

Diversity is a critical component that will determine the success of Try Studio. Although we have students with various strengths and backgrounds, we have gaps in diversity. Potential solutions for these gaps must always be considered as they may hurt the team's dynamic.

Team Background
---

In addition to being a Computer Science specialist at the University of Toronto:

Darren Moore was a developer of The Age of Empires IV, and a former TA for computer graphics.

Ryan Ro is a former full-stack web developer and was TA in the field as well.

Tim Zhang is a former backend developer at a startup.

Yuhao Kan is a former iOS developer and has participated in the University of Toronto's Hatchery program.

Tianquan (Andy) Di is a chinese flute player, member of a choir.


## Strengths and Weaknesses

Try Studio consists of a group of students who have various expertise related to the field of computer science. Darren has hosted game development events at U of T. Darren’s strong organizational skills and project management skills are highly valuable to Try Studio.

Furthermore, we have Ryan Ro, who has exceptional experience in using version control systems such as Git. Ryan is also a quick learner and has excellent execution skills. With Ryan on Try Studio, the team can have a much modular and structural software design process. Ryan will contribute to Try Studio through his strong decision-making skills and web development expertise. 

Moreover, Tim Zhang has firsthand startup experience and has personally dealt with customers and clients, which will add significant value to Try Studio when it comes to its users.

On the other side of the team, we have Yuhao Kan, who has previous experiences in startup funding. Yuhao’s experience can set the base and increase the team’s efficiency in building a startup.

Last but not least, we have Tianquan (Andy) Di. Besides Andy’s strength in software development, Andy has a strong experience in live music performance and music production. He has an insight on music users’ pain in using the existing licensing products on the market. Andy will contribute to Try Studio by his musician background as well as strong programming skills.

While Try Studio’s members all have a strong computer science background, the team has limitations in other areas. For instance, none of us have had major business experience. This may have some effect when it comes to market research. Additionally, none of us are designers. This may hurt our UI/UX, which is vital area for our end product.

In addition to the above areas, Try Studio also needs to pay attention to the balance in technical skills of the team. For example, although we have five computer science students, the group is still lacking knowledge in areas of database management systems and dev-ops. Since our product manages music licenses, having a reliable database is highly important. Deployment and continuous integration is also an important area we need to get more comfortable with. As a new company with many tasks to tackle in addition to these points, we need to push ourselves out of our comfort zone to make sure we stay on top of things.


### Subject Matter Experts

Our team members are connected with choral conductors in the Faculty of Music, who are highly experienced in ensemble-based musical performances. These conductors can share insights on SOCAN’s licensing process as well as reveal existing problems in music licensing to us. To complement our weakness in business skills related to the global music market, Try Studio plans to maintain consistent communication with personnel from SOCAN. Such connections will ensure that we have subject matter experts that can help in areas we may be weak in. 

## Diversity

Try Studio currently has 5 members. This potentially puts a constraint on the team’s diversity. For instance, we do not have any female members on the team. As a result, we need to be extra careful and take both female and male users into account when making product decisions. In addition to this, all being computer science specialists, we all are rather technologically savvy, which may not represent the user population and our opinions of "common sense" may be unknowingly biased. Furthermore, all of our group members are from Canada or east Asia. This lack of ethnic diversity may get in the way of Try Studio’s long-term goal of targetting the entire globe.

### How this can impact us

The aforementioned lack of diversity shows that, without corresponding actions, it can deteriorate the team's customer development, market expansion, and product development. For instance, without additional consideration, Try Studio may have difficulty designing a product that is suitable for all customers in the market. If Try Studio develops a product right now, it may have a high bias towards east Asian men who are technologically savvy. Overall, we need to be careful of our lack of gender and regional diversity, by making sure we do our best to include the population we may not naturally represent.
